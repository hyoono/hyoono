## Git Cheat Sheet
<h3 align="center">Here are some commands to use for the basic operation of Git:</h3>

<h4>1. git clone</h4>

```git
Used for cloning a repository that already exists.

Example:

git clone https://github.com/hyoono/hyoono.git 
//This will clone the repository to the current local directory on the machine
```
<h4>2. git push and git pull</h4>

```git
Used for updating either your local cloned copy of the repository (pull) or the main source by uploading all commits (push)

Example:

git push origin main
//will push all changes and work into the remote branch (main) of the repository.

git pull origin main
//fetches the remote specified branch (main) and merges it with the local branch.
```

<h4>3. git commit</h4>

```git
Adds a permanent record of changes of the file in version history

Example:

git commit -a 
//-a or --all will work the same
//stages all modified or deleted files for commit; New files that have not been told to Git are unaffected.
```

<h4>4. git merge</h4>

```git
Merges the main branch in remote to the current local branch.

Example:

git merge --no-commit
//merges the local branch and the main branch without creating a merge commit
```

<h4>5. git status</h4>

```git
Shows which branch you are modifying.

Example:

git status -v
//--verbose will work as well
//will show the full repository changes and current changes that are staged to be committed. 
```
